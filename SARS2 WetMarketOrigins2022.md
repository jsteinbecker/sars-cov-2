The animal reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown despite reports of various SARS-CoV2-related viruses in Asian Rhinolophus bats1–4
, including the closest virus from
R. afnis, RaTG135,6
 and in pangolins7–9
. SARS-CoV-2 presents a mosaic genome,
to which diferent progenitors contribute. The spike sequence determines the
binding afnity and accessibility of its receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the cellular
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and is responsible for host
range10–12. SARS-CoV-2 progenitor bat viruses genetically close to SARS-CoV-2 and
able to enter human cells through a human ACE2 pathway have not yet been
identifed, though they would be key in understanding the origin of the epidemics.
Here we show that such viruses indeed circulate in cave bats living in the limestone
karstic terrain in North Laos, within the Indochinese peninsula. We found that the
RBDs of these viruses difer from that of SARS-CoV-2 by only one or two residues
at the interface with ACE2, bind more efciently to the hACE2 protein than
the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain isolated in early human cases, and mediate
hACE2-dependent entry and replication in human cells, which is inhibited by
antibodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. None of these bat viruses harbors a furin
cleavage site in the spike. Our fndings therefore indicate that bat-borne SARS-CoV2-like viruses potentially infectious for humans circulate in Rhinolophus spp. in the
Indochinese peninsula.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2, as its mode of introduction into the human
population, is currently unknown. Since its emergence, numerous
animal species have been studied to identify possible reservoirs and/
or intermediate hosts of the virus, including a large diversity of insectivorous bats of the genus Rhinolophus. Despite the recent report of
various SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in Rhinolophus shameli (isolated
in Cambodia in 201013), R. pusillus and R. malayanus (China, 2020 and
2019 respectively2
), in R. acuminatus (Thailand, 20203
) and R. cornutus
( Japan, 20134
), the closest SARS-CoV-2 bat-borne genome still remains
the one from R. affinis, RaTG13 (China, 2013)5,6
 with 96.1% similarity at
the whole genome level. Several studies also suggested the involvement
of pangolin coronaviruses in the emergence of SARS-CoV-27–9
. Since
its appearance in humans, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved through sporadic
mutations and recombination events14, some of which correspond to
gains in fitness allowing the virus to spread more widely, or to escape
neutralizing antibodies15.
To decipher the origin of SARS-CoV-2, it is therefore essential to ascertain the diversity of animal coronaviruses and more specifically of bat
coronaviruses. Although the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in bats is a
major goal, a more realistic objective is to identify the sequences that
contribute to its mosaicism. The spike sequence appears essential, as it
determines the binding affinity and accessibility of the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) to the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
receptor and is therefore responsible for host range10–12. The closest
related bat strain identified to date (RaTG13) has a low RBD sequence
similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and, with only 11/17 human ACE2 (hACE2)
contact amino-acid residues conserved with SARS-CoV-2, its affinity
to hACE2 is very limited16. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 poorly infects bats

and bat cells tested so far17. In addition, no bat SARS-CoV-2-like virus
has been shown to use hACE2 to efficiently enter human cells, and none
presents the furin cleavage site that is associated with an increased
pathogenicity in humans18. SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds to Rhinolophus
macrotis ACE2 with a lower affinity than to hACE219. An essential piece
of information, i.e. finding bat viruses with an RBD motif close to that
of SARS-CoV-2 and capable of binding to hACE2 with high affinity, is
therefore missing.
We hypothesized that this type of virus could be identified in bats
living in the limestone karstic terrain common to China, Laos, and
Vietnam in the Indochinese peninsula. We report here the presence
of sarbecoviruses close to SARS-CoV-2 whose RBDs differ from that
of SARS-CoV-2 by only one or two contact residues, that strongly bind
to the hACE2 protein, and mediate a hACE2-dependent entry and
replication into human cells. Despite the absence of the furin cleavage
site, these viruses may have contributed to SARS-CoV-2’s origin and
may intrinsically pose a future risk of direct transmission to humans.
Diversity of bat and coronavirus species
A total of 645 bats belonging to six families and 46 species were captured
(Table S1). Two hundred and forty-seven blood samples, 608 saliva, 539
anal/feces, and 157 urine swabs were collected from the northern part
of Laos (Table S2). We first screened all 539 feces samples through a
pan-coronavirus RT nested PCR approach20. Overall, 24 individuals
of 10 species were positive, and one individual (BANAL-27) was
concomitantly infected by an alphacoronavirus and a betacoronavirus
(Table S3). BLAST analysis of amplicons identified alphacoronavirus
sequences of the Decacovirus, Pedacovirus, and Rhinacovirus subgenera
and betacoronavirus sequences of the Nobecovirus and Sarbecovirus
subgenera. Sequences of the Sarbecovirus subgenus were all identified
from Rhinolophus individuals belonging to three different species
i.e., R. malayanus, R. marshalli, and R. pusillus. Positive individuals
were trapped in three different districts, and those infected with a
sarbecovirus were all from the Fueng district in Vientiane Province
(Fig. 1a, site 1).
NGS together with Sanger sequencing was used to obtain a
complete genomic sequence of five of the seven sarbecoviruses
(Fig. 1, Table S4). The coverage of the genome of the remaining two
sarbecoviruses, i.e. BANAL-27 and BANAL-242 sampled from R. pusillus
and R. malayanus bats respectively, was 90% and therefore they were
not included in the final analyses. Phylogenetic analyses performed
on the receptor-binding protein domain of lineages A and B human
SARS-CoV-221, and on representative bat and pangolin sarbecoviruses,
placed the Laotian R. malayanus BANAL-52, R. pusillus BANAL-103, and
R. marshalli BANAL-236 coronaviruses close to human SARS-CoV-2
and pangolin coronaviruses collected in 2019, while R. malayanus
BANAL-116 and BANAL-247 coronaviruses belonged to a sister clade
with other bat coronaviruses (RmYN02, RacCS203, RpYN06, and PrC31)
from different Rhinolophus species. Pangolin coronaviruses sampled
in 2017 displayed a basal position relative to these strains (Fig. 1b).
Interestingly, one should note that very similar SARS-CoV-2-like viruses
are shared by different bat species, suggesting a possible circulation of
viruses between different species living sympatrically in the same caves.
These results are consistent with the similarity plot analysis showing
that RaTG13 and BANAL-52 bat coronaviruses exhibit high nucleotide
identity with SARS-CoV-2 throughout the length of the genome (96.8%
for BANAL-52 and 96.1% for RaTG13). Interestingly, BANAL-52 presents
a higher level of nucleotide conservation than RaTG13 in the S1 domain
of the spike, and especially in the spike’s N-terminal domain (NTD)
and RBD (Fig. 1c). These observations are congruent with amino-acid
identities between human SARS-CoV-2 and representative bat and
pangolin coronaviruses, which present a high level of conservation,
except for ORF8 of bat BANAL-116, BANAL-247, Rc-o319 and RmYN02
(Supp. Figure 1). Interestingly, the S1 domain of the spike (and especially
the N-terminal domain) presents a lower degree of conservation in
several bat coronaviruses, suggesting that this domain may reflect a
relative degree of adaptation of the virus to its mammalian host (Fig. 1d,
Extended Data Fig. 1).
Bat Sarbecovirus evolutionary history
Following GARD analysis, we identified 14 recombinant breakpoints
during the evolutionary history of sarbecoviruses, which were further
confirmed by phylogenetic analyses performed on the 15 fragments
of sequences defined by the breakpoints (Fig. 2, Supp. Figure 2).
No specific signature was identified in the breakpoints (Table S5).
SARS-CoV-2 presents a mosaic genome, to which contributed more
than five sequences close to sequences published or determined
during this study: R. malayanus RmYN02 and R. pusillus RpYN06
viruses found in China in 2019, R. affinis RaTG13 coronavirus found in
China in 2013, and R. malayanus BANAL-52 and R. pusillus BANAL-103
found in North Laos in 2020 (this study). No pangolin coronavirus
sequence was immediately associated with a recombination event
at the origin of SARS-CoV-2. Laotian Rhinolophus bat coronaviruses
presented a lower degree of recombination compared to SARS-CoV-2.
Such recombination events occurred between other BANAL viruses
isolated from bats living sympatrically in caves in the same area.
Interestingly, the origin of several fragments of SARS-CoV-2
genomes could be assigned to several donor strains and not a unique
donor sequence. For example, a breakpoint was identified 7 nucleotides upstream of the RBD region of S1: the downstream fragment of
SARS-CoV-2, which comprises the RBD and the beginning of S2, could
involve BANAL-52 R. malayanus, BANAL-103 R. pusillus, and BANAL-236
R. marshalli viruses, which formed a highly supported sister clade of
SARS-CoV-2 (fragment 11, Supp. Figure 2). In a more basal position are
R. shameli bat coronaviruses and pangolin-2019 coronaviruses, consistent with the conservation of RBD amino-acid sequences among
SARS-CoV-2 and representative bat and pangolin coronaviruses
(Extended Data Fig. 2). Among the 17 residues that interact with human
ACE2, 16 are conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and BANAL-52 or -103
(one mismatch, H498Q), and 15/17 are conserved for BANAL-236 (two
mismatches, K493Q and H498Q) while only 13/17 residues are conserved
for the Cambodian bat R. shameli virus and 11/17 for the Chinese bat
R. affinis RaTG13 virus. At the full spike protein level, bat R. affinis
RaTG13 and pangolin-2017 P4L viruses looked closer to SARS-CoV-2
than bat R. malayanus BANAL-52, but this effect is due to a higher degree
of conservation in S2. All these viruses shared the absence of a furin
cleavage site and the conservation of the internal fusion peptide (Supp.
Figures 1 & 3 and Extended Data Fig. 3).
Interaction of BANAL RBDs with ACE2
Biolayer interferometry experiments to measure the interaction
between hACE2 and the RBDs of BANAL-52/103 (which have identical
residues in the receptor-binding motif) (Extended Data Fig. 2), BANAL236 and SARS-CoV-2 (residues 233-524), resulted in a dissociation
constant Kd three times lower for the BANAL RBDs compared to
SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3a). This higher affinity can be attributed to the Q498H
mismatch that has been reported to increase the affinity of SARS-CoV-2
RBD for hACE2, and also to be involved in the host range expansion of
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 like viruses22–29.
To study the effect of the mutations at the interface between these
RBDs and hACE2, we performed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of the SARS-CoV-2, BANAL-236 and BANAL-52/103 RBD/hACE2
complexes initiated from the crystal structure and homology models
of these systems, respectively (Table S6). Cluster analysis of the MD
trajectories revealed that, at the RBD-hACE2 interface, both BANAL
complexes were identical to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/hACE2 complex
within 2 Å backbone RMSD (Extended Data Fig. 4), except for one of

the BANAL-52/103 simulations that displayed larger conformational
variability of the RBD residues S443-Y449 (Supp. Methods and Extended
Data Fig. 5). Empirical scoring functions predicted a similar RBD/hACE2
binding energy in all three complexes (Extended Data Fig. 6).
The analysis of the persistence of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges
provided further insights into the effect of the substitutions at the
RBD/hACE2 interface (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 7). The H498Q
mismatch present in both BANAL-52/103 and BANAL-236 RBDs disrupted the hydrogen bonds between RBD Q498 and both hACE2 K353
and Q42. However, these hydrogen bonds were only transiently formed
in the SARS-CoV-2 complex: more persistent hydrogen bonds in this
region (RBD T500 – hACE2 D355, RBD G502 – hACE2 K353, RBD Y505
– hACE2 E37) were not affected. The K493Q mismatch enabled the
formation of two salt bridges between RBD and hACE2 that were not
present in the SARS-CoV-2 complex (RBD K493 – hACE2 E35 and RBD
K493 – hACE2 D38).
For further insight into the molecular details of these interactions, we
determined the crystal structure of the complex BANAL-236 RBD with the
hACE2 peptidase domain to 2.9 Å resolution (Table S7). The overall structure of this RBD is identical to that of the SARS-CoV-2 (RMSD 0.360 Å,
150 Cα). The only significant difference is in the region between amino
acids D363 and S375 (Fig. 3c, arrow). In this region, BANAL spikes have
the A372T mismatch, which converts the sequence 370NSA372 to 370NST372,
an N-linked glycosylation sequon. The crystals indeed showed clear
electron density for the first N-acetylglucosamine residue of glycan
attached to N370. The main chain at residue T372 makes a hydrogen bond
with the glycan residue, altering the conformation of the main chain
downstream which results in partial unwinding of helix H4 in RBD 236.
The calculation of a simulated annealing composite omit map for the
segment D363-S375 confirms the correct assignment of the structure
for this polypeptide segment and the N-glycosylation at residue N370
(Extended Data Fig. 8).
As expected, most of the interactions observed in the SARS-CoV-2
RBD/hACE2 complex30 are also present in the structure of the BANAL236 RBD/hACE2 complex. In these interfaces, there are three main
clusters of interactions as indicated in Fig. 3c (insets). The sequence
mismatches are in clusters 2 (making the salt bridge RBD K493 – hACE2
E35) and 3 (hydrogen bond between RBD H498 and D38). Although the
interaction K493-E35 contributes to stabilizing the complex, it does not
seem to affect drastically the binding to hACE2 because both BANAL
RBDs have similar Kd values.
Virus replication in human cells
To assess whether the BANAL-236 spike protein could mediate entry
into cells expressing human ACE2, we generated lentiviral particles
pseudotyped with the Wuhan or the BANAL-236 spikes (Supp. Figure 4).
We detected spike-mediated entry of the BANAL-236 spike-pseudotyped
lentivirus in 293T-ACE2, contrarily to control cells not expressing hACE2
(Fig. 4a). Entry was blocked by human sera neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, but
not by control non-neutralizing sera, demonstrating that neutralization
of BANAL-236 was specific for epitopes shared with the spike of
SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4b).
In order to isolate infectious viruses, rectal swabs were inoculated
on VeroE6 cells. No CPE was observed 3 and 4 days after infection, but
viral RNAs were detected for one of the 2 wells inoculated with the
BANAL-236 sample (CT = 25.1 at D3, CT = 21.7 at D4). The culture supernatant (C1) formed plaques on VeroE6 and the titer was 3800 pfu/mL.
A C2 viral stock was prepared by amplification on VeroE6 at a MOI of
10−4. The culture supernatant was harvested on day 4 when CPE was
observed and titrated on VeroE6 (Extended Data Fig. 9). The plaques’
phenotype was small, but the titer reached 2.6.106
 pfu/mL. The random
NGS performed on the RNA extracted from this stock confirmed that
the culture was pure and corresponded to the BANAL-236 virus, without any non-synonymous mutations between the original BANAL-236
genome and the C2 viral stock. Replication of BANAL-236 in VeroE6
was efficiently inhibited by soluble human ACE2, thus showing that
entry and propagation was largely ACE2-dependent (Fig. 4c, Extended
Data Fig. 9). Furthermore, BANAL-236 replicated in human cell lines
expressing endogenous levels of ACE2, Calu-3 and Caco-2 (Fig. 4c).
The kinetics of RNA synthesis were slower compared to Wuhan virus.
Infectious viral particles were produced at D4 in the supernatant of
Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells (respectively 104.7 and 102.9 pfu/mL).
Discussion
Many sarbecoviruses circulate in Rhinolophus colonies living in
caves in China and probably also in neighboring countries further
south31–33. During the course of a prospective study in Northern Laos,
we have identified, among other coronaviruses, five sarbecoviruses
for which we obtained full-length sequences. Among these, three
(BANAL-52, -103, and -236) were considered to be close to SARS-CoV-2
because of the similarity of one of the S1 domains (NTD, RBD) or S2
with SARS-CoV-2.
Because genomic regions subject to recombination are likely contributing to host-virus interactions, we compared SARS-CoV-2 strains
from the two lineages identified at the very onset of the COVID-19
outbreak21 to these novel bat sarbecoviruses and to pangolin strains
within the SARS-CoV-2 clade. Strains close to R. pusillus RpYN06, R.
malayanus RmYN02, and Rhinolophus sp. PrC31 isolated in China in
2018-2019, along with R. malayanus BANAL-52, R. pusillus BANAL-103,
and R. marshalli BANAL-236 isolated in Laos in 2020, contributed to
the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in different regions of the genome. No
closer viral genome has yet been identified as a possible contributor,
and pangolin coronaviruses appear as more distantly related than bat
coronaviruses. We identified potential recombination sites, allowing
for the reconstruction of the phylogenetic history of early isolated
SARS-CoV-2 strains between homologous regions defined by recombination points. We identified a breakpoint at the beginning of the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD, resulting in a downstream fragment key for the virus
tropism and host spectrum composed of the RBD, the furin cleavage
site, and ending in the N-terminal region of S2. Despite the absence of
the furin site, phylogenetic reconstruction of this fragment revealed
that Laotian R. malayanus BANAL-52, R. pusillus BANAL-103, and R. marshalli BANAL-236 coronaviruses are the closest ancestors of SARS-CoV-2
known to date. ORF8 was highly divergent between SARS-CoV-2 related
genomes. ORF8 from strains BANAL-52, -103, -236, like that of RaTG13,
were closer to SARS-CoV-2 than to pangolin strains. ORF8 encodes a
protein that has been proposed to participate in immune evasion34
and is deleted in many human SARS-CoV-2 strains that appeared after
March 202035, which is reminiscent of the deletions identified during
the 2003 SARS epidemic36. Therefore, the presence of ORF8 is consistent with bats acting as a natural reservoir of early strains of SARS-CoV-2.
Structural and functional biology studies have identified the RBD
domain that mediates the interaction with hACE2 and host range, as
well as the major amino acids that are involved30,37,38. The RBDs (BANAL52, -103, and -236) are closer to SARS-CoV-2 than that of any other bat
strain described so far, in particular that of RaTG13, the virus identified
in R. affinis from the Mojiang mineshaft where pneumonia cases with
clinical characteristics a posteriori interpreted as similar to COVID-196
were recorded in 201239,40. Overall, one (H498Q (BANAL-103 and -52))
or two (K493Q and H498Q (BANAL-236)) amino acids interacting with
hACE2 are substituted in these strains in comparison to SARS-CoV-2.
These mutations did not destabilize the BANAL-236 / hACE2 interface, as shown by the BLI experiments (Fig. 3a) and analyzed by MD
simulations.
Our results therefore support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 could
originally result from a recombination of sequences pre-existing in
Rhinolophus bats living in the extensive limestone cave systems of
South-East Asia and South China41,42. Many species forage in the same
A C C E L E R A T E D A R TI C L E P R E VI E W
cave areas, including R. malayanus and R. pusillus43. In addition, the
distribution of R. marshalli, R. malayanus, and R. pusillus overlaps in the
Indochinese sub-region (Supp. Figure 5), which means they may share
caves as roost sites and foraging habitats44. With the novel viruses here
described, understanding the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 does not need
to hypothesize recombination or natural selection for increased RBD
affinity for hACE2 in an intermediate host like the pangolin before spillover45, nor natural selection in humans following spillover46. However,
we found no furin cleavage site in any of these viruses on sequences
determined from original fecal swab samples, devoid of any risk of
counterselection of the furin site by amplification in Vero cells18. Lack
of furin cleavage site may be explained by insufficient sampling in bats.
Based on comparison of the sequences around the S1/S2 cleavage site
(Extended Data Fig. 3), it has been suggested that the furin cleavage
site present in SARS-CoV-2 could originate from recombination events
between SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses co-circulating in bats2,47,
meaning that BANAL-116, BANAL-247, bat RmYN022
 and bat RacCS2033
coronaviruses may share a common history with SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, the furin cleavage site could have been acquired through
passages of the virus in an alternate host or during an early poorly
symptomatic unreported circulation in humans. Finally, the epidemiological link between these bat viruses and the first human cases
remains to be established.
As expected from the high affinity for ACE2 of the S ectodomain of
BANAL-236, pseudoviruses expressing it were able to enter efficiently
human cells expressing endogenous hACE2 using an ACE2-dependent
pathway. However, alternative routes of entry may still exist, especially
in cells that do not express ACE248. Entry was blocked by a serum
neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. The RaTG13 strain, the closest to SARS-CoV-2
known before, had never been isolated. In contrast, preliminary studies
show that BANAL-236 replicated in primate VeroE6 cells with a small
plaque phenotype compared to SARS-CoV-2. Further analysis may
indicate more clearly which steps shape infectivity.
To conclude, our results pinpoint the presence of new bat
sarbecoviruses that seem to have the same potential for infecting
humans as early strains of SARS-CoV-2. Guano collectors, or certain
ascetic religious communities who spend time in or very close to caves,
as well as tourists visiting caves, are particularly at risk of being exposed.
Further investigations are needed to assess if such exposed populations
have been infected, symptomatically or not, by one of these viruses,
and whether infection could confer protection against subsequent
SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this context, it is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2
with the furin site deleted replicates in hamsters and in transgenic mice
expressing hACE2, but leads to less severe disease while protecting
from rechallenge with wild-type SARS-CoV-218.

Methods
Ethical and legal statements
The bat study was approved by the wildlife authorities of the
Department of Forest Resource Management (DFRM), and the Ministry
of Agriculture and Forestry, Lao PDR, No. 2493/DFRM, issued on May 21,
2020; No. 0755/MAF issued on June 2, 2020. All animals were captured,
handled, and sampled following previously published protocols
and ASM guidelines52,53. Exportation from Lao and importation in
France were conducted according to national regulations. Human
serum samples used for neutralization assays were already available54
and selected based on their status regarding seroneutralization of
SARS-CoV-2. They were collected following a protocol approved by
the Lao National Ethics Committee for Health Research (NECHR) (Ref
#052/2020).
Biosafety
Both the Institut Pasteur du Laos (IPL) and the Faculty of Environmental
Science have extensive experience in safely collecting bats (appropriate biosafety training and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for
collectors). In this study, training prior to field work was organized
once for field work participants. The aim was to teach participants
on the transmission risks of infectious agents from bats and how to
identify, assess, and mitigate these risks, as well to practice the use
of PPE.
During field collection, sampling stations were selected to minimize
potential exposure to infectious agents and stress on the animals during the handling time by selecting (1) an area easy to disinfect, (2) out
of view of the general public, (3) a location that would not expose the
general population (like a picnic area), and (4) procedures that reduce
time and stress on bats caused by handling. For handling bats and bat
samples the following minimum PPE was required: eye protection, an
N95 respirator, long clothing/cover all, and latex gloves (2pairs). All
wastes were disposed of in biohazard bags and were transported to a
disposal site of IPL in Vientiane capital. Each sample box containing
81 cryovial tubes was put inside individual plastic ziplock and transported from field to IPL using dry ice by packing them in a polystyrene
foam box. At IPL, samples were stored in a specific -80 °C freezer until
analysis.
For initial sample analysis at IPL, samples were transferred to BSL-3
room for nucleic acid extraction. Initial Coronavirus screening by
RT-PCR was then performed under internal regulation on biosafety
and security of IPL. Sample extracted products (50 µl) were stored
in NucleoSpin 8 sample boxes (8x12) and sent to IP-Paris by packing
them in the individual plastic ziplock and using dry ice. Aliquots of
anal swab samples were sent in a separated box by individually triple
packaging in dry ice.
All experiments on potentially infectious samples done at Institut
Pasteur (Paris) were conducted in BSL-3 laboratories according to
procedures adapted to respiratory viruses.
Bat sampling areas and sample collection
Trapping sessions were conducted on four sites, in Fueng and Meth Districts, Vientiane Province, and in Namor and Xay Districts, Oudomxay
Province, between July 2020 and January 2021 (Fig. 1a, Table S1 and
S2). Bats were captured using four-bank harp traps55 and mist nets set
in forest patches between rice fields/orange/banana plantations and
karst limestone formations, for 5-8 nights depending on accessibility.
Harp traps were set across natural trails in patches of forest understory. Mist nets were set across natural trails, at the edges of forests,
at entrances of caves, and in areas near cave entrances, as well as in
open areas or those with high forest canopy. Bats were morphologically identified following morphological criteria55–57. Other data such
as forearm length (FA), sex, developmental stage (adult or juvenile) and
reproductive condition (pregnant or lactating) were also recorded.
Bats were sampled for saliva, feces and/or urine, and blood before
release at the capture site. Species identification of PCR-positive individuals was confirmed by sequencing the mitochondrial Cytochrome
oxidase 132.
Initial Coronavirus screening
Total RNA was extracted from feces samples using the NucleoSpin 8
virus kit (Macherey Nagel). cDNA was synthesized using the Maxima H
minus first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific) and random
hexamers following the manufacturer’s instructions. The presence of
coronaviruses was tested by a nested PCR approach using PCR master
mix (Promega) and by targeting the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase
gene using combinations of degenerate and non-degenerate consensus
primers as previously described20. PCR products of the expected size
were directly sequenced on both strands by Sanger sequencing using
the nested PCR primers. The sequences obtained were confirmed by
similarity analysis using the NCBI BLASTn search (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/BLAST).
Primer design for Betacoronavirus enrichment before
Next-Generation Sequencing
Betacoronavirus enrichment was performed at the genus level by
adapting a previously described protocol58 based on k-mers for
targeted-sequence enrichment prior to NGS. Briefly, 2,000 complete
Betacoronavirus genomes were downloaded from the GenBank and
GISAID databases and then clustered to a 95% sequence identity
using CD-HIT-EST59. Overall, 185 representative sequences of all
betacoronaviruses were used for further analysis. Due to the high
diversity within the genus Betacoronavirus, the full genomes belonging
to the subgenera Sarbecovirus, Nobecovirus, and Merbecovirus plus
Embecovirus were separately aligned using MAFFT multiple sequence
alignment software and used to design 13-mer spiked primers per
cluster. The genomic position of the full set of primers was extracted
from some representative subgenera sequences and close primers
were removed. Finally, 416 spiked primers were synthesized by Eurofins
Genomics Germany GmbH.
Sample preparation for sequencing
Reverse transcription was performed using the mix of spiked primers
and random hexamers at a 10:1 ratio using the SuperScript™ IV
First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). After a denaturation step
at 95 °C for 3 min in the presence of dNTPs (500 µM), DTT (5 mM), and
RNaseOUT inhibitor, the RT reaction was incubated for 10 thermal
cycles consisting of 6 steps at 8 °C for 12 s, 15 °C for 45 s, 20 °C for
45 s, 30 °C for 30 s, 35 °C for 2 min and 42 °C for 3 min, followed by a
final incubation step at 42 °C for 20 min, as previously described60.
Double-stranded cDNA was generated using the Sequenase2.0 DNA
Polymerase (Applied Biosystems™) in presence of dNTPs and then
purified using the Beckman Coulter™ Agencourt AMPure XP.
For samples with a low nucleic acid content, a random amplification
step was performed using the MALBAC Single Cell WGA kit (Yikon
Genomics, Promega). The amplified product was then purified using
AMPure XP Beads, eluted in a final volume of 20 µL of low TE (10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8,0), 0,1 mM EDTA), and quantified with the Qubit™ DNA
HS Assay (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.).
Libraries were generated using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep
kit (New England Biolabs) after a fragmentation step using the Covaris
M220 Focused-ultrasonicator using microTUBE-15 (Peak Incident
power (W)=18, Duty Factor=20%, Cycles per Burst=50, Treatment time
(sec)=60). The PCR amplified libraries were cleaned up using 0.9X
AMPure XP Beads and checked on the 2100 Bioanalyzer system with the
High-Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technologies, France) and quantified
with the Qubit™ DNA HS Assay. Finally, the dual-multiplexed libraries
were pooled (six samples/pool) and run on the Illumina NextSeq500
platform with High Output Kit v2.5 (150 Cycles).

Amplicon sequencing
In addition to enrichment-based sequencing, cDNA was amplified using
the AmpliSeq for Illumina SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel (cat# 20020496),
applying twenty-six amplification cycles in PCR1 and nine cycles in
PCR2. Primers at the end of the amplicons were partially digested
during the library preparation, following manufacturer’s instructions.
Libraries were barcoded individually using the Illumina UD dual-indexes
and normalized with the AmpliSeq Library Equalizer for Illumina (cat#
20019171), then pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq500
instrument using a Mid Output v2.5 kit (SR 150 cycles). To eliminate
residual PCR primer sequences, raw reads were trimmed by 15 bases
at each end and special attention was paid to checking that internal
sequences corresponding to primer regions in overlapping amplicons
did not derive from primer sequences of the multiplex PCR. As an
internal control, we verified that sequences of the complete genome
of sample BANAL-236 obtained from the enrichment-based sequencing
approach and from the AmpliSeq approach were identical.
Genome assembly and finishing
Raw reads from the enrichment-based sequencing were processed with
an in-house bioinformatics pipeline (Microseek; Bigot et al., submitted)
comprising quality check and trimming, reads normalization, de novo
assembly, and ORF prediction of contigs and singletons, followed by 3
levels of taxonomic assignation61. Sequences identified as Sarbecovirus
were then mapped onto appropriate reference sequences using CLC
Genomics Workbench 20.0 (Qiagen). Trimmed reads from the amplicon
sequencing were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome first, then mapped
again (refined mapping) to the closest genome relative. When needed,
complete genomes were obtained by conventional PCR and Sanger
sequencing. Briefly, viral RNA was reverse transcribed using the
SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA) and cDNA was
subsequently used to fill the gaps in the genomes using the Phusion
High Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, France) and
specific primers flanking the missing regions. Positive PCR products
were further purified and sequenced by Sanger sequencing at Eurofins
Genomics.
Recombination and phylogenetic analyses
Identification of recombination events occurring during the
evolutionary history of bat sarbecoviruses was performed using
the IDPlot package62, a web-based workflow that includes multiple
sequence alignment and phylogeny-based breakpoints prediction
using the GARD algorithm from the HyPhy genetic analysis suite63. First,
a comprehensive analysis comprising 106 sequences and covering all
non-human Sarbecovirus and Sarbecovirus-related complete genomes
available in GenBank and GISAID databases was performed, including
prototype strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated in 2019. Special attention
was paid to including bat-borne and pangolin-borne viral sequences
in order to maximize the ability to capture a large diversity of the
sarbecoviruses. Then, a reduced set of 36 sequences was chosen
because of their phylogenetic proximity with SARS-CoV-2, and the
GARD algorithm was run to identify recombination breakpoints in
Laotian and representative human, bat, and pangolin sarbecoviruses.
Breakpoint coordinates were confirmed by performing phylogenetic
analyses on the corresponding fragments using PhyML implemented
through the NGPhylogeny portal50. Branch support was evaluated with
the aBayes parameter.
Generation of lentiviral pseudoviruses
The BANAL-236 and Wuhan synthetic spike genes were cloned into
the pVAX1 vector with a cytoplasmic tail truncation of 19 amino
acids. Pseudotyped lentiviral particles were prepared using HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216) seeded in 10-cm dishes. 293T cells were
co-transfected with a 5 µg of spike-encoding plasmid, 10 µg of lentiviral
backbone plasmid expressing the firefly luciferase (pHAGE-CMV-Luc
2-IRES-ZsGreen-W), and 3.3 µg of each lentiviral helper plasmid
expressing HIV Gag-Pol (HDM-Hgpm2), Tat (HDM-tat1b), and Rev
(pRC-CMV-Rev1b) using calcium-phosphate precipitation64. The
medium was replaced 5 h post-transfection by 6 mL of DMEM without
fetal calf serum (FCS) and phenol red. Pseudotyped particles were
harvested 48 h post-transfection, clarified by centrifugation at 2500
g for 5 min and frozen at −80 °C. Mock pseudotyped lentivirus was
generated as above but in the absence of an S-expressing plasmid.
Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus entry assays
HEK-293T cells stably expressing human ACE2 (293T-ACE2) were
transduced in suspension by mixing 50 µL of 3-fold serial dilutions
of S-pseudotyped lentiviruses with 50 µL of cells at 4.105
 cells/mL in
96-well white culture plates65. At 60-72 h post-transduction, 100 µL of
Bright-Glo luciferase substrate (Promega) were added to the wells and
luminescence was measured using a Berthold Centro XS luminometer.
Neutralization assays
Sera neutralizing or not SARS-CoV-2 were described in54. They were
decomplemented at 56 °C for 30 min and 2.5 µL were incubated with
0.5 µL of S-pseudotyped lentiviruses in a final volume of 50 µL of
DMEM-10% FCS without phenol red in 96-well white culture plates. After
30 min at room temperature, 50 µL of 293T-ACE2 cells in suspension
at 4.105
 cells/mL were mixed to the wells. Luminescence was measured
at 60-72 h post-transduction as described above. Neutralization was
calculated using the following formula: 1 – (RLU in presence of serum/
(mean of RLU in absence of serum determined in 12 wells – 3 x STD).
Virus isolation and multiplication
Rectal swabs were inoculated in duplicate in 24-well plates containing
VeroE6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) (1/5 dilution in 100 µL of DMEM without
FCS supplemented with 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, 1% Fungizone,
and 1 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin). After 1 h of adsorption at 37 °C,
inoculum was removed and 1 mL of the medium described above was
added. Three and 4 days after infection, cytopathic effect (CPE) was
monitored and 100 µL of supernatant was collected for RNA extraction.
RT-qPCR targeting a conserved sequence in the E gene was performed as
described66. Culture supernatant (C1) was harvested at day 4 and titrated
by plaque assay on VeroE6 overlaid with 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose
containing 1 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin. A viral stock was prepared by
amplification on VeroE6 cells at a MOI of 10−4. Culture supernatant (C2)
was harvested at day 4 when massive CPE was observed and titrated
by plaque assay on VeroE6 as described above. A C3 viral stock was
produced by a subsequent viral amplification at a MOI of 10−4 for 3
days on VeroE6. RNA was extracted from the viral stock and submitted
to random NGS analysis using the SMARTer® Stranded Total RNA-Seq
Kit v3 - Pico Input Mammalian (Takara Bio USA, Inc.). Raw reads were
processed with Microseek pipeline, as described above.
For infection experiments, VeroE6 or human cell lines Calu-3 (lung
cells, ATCC HTB-55) and Caco-2 (intestinal cells, ATCC HTB-37) were
infected in triplicate in 24-well plates with BANAL-236 (C3) or Wuhan
viral stocks at a MOI of 0.0001 and 0.01 respectively. Human soluble
ACE2 was pre-incubated at 25 µg/mL67 for 30 min with the viral inoculum
before VeroE6 infection. Infections were carried out without TPCK
in the medium described above for 3 and 4 days. Supernatants were
recovered at 0-, 3- and 4-days post-infection and genome copy number
and viral titers were quantified as described above.
Protein expression and purification
BANAL-52/103, BANAL-236 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs (residues 233-524,
with C-terminal 8xHis-Strep and AVI tags) and hACE2 peptidase domain
(residues 19-615, with C-terminal 8xHis tag) were expressed in Expi293F
cells at 37 °C and 8% CO2 (GnTI- Expi293™, ThermoFisher Scientific).
Cell culture supernatants were collected five days post transfection
A C C E L E R A T E D A R TI C L E P R E VI E W
and purified by affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) using a 200 10/300 GL column pre-equilibrated
in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl.
For crystallization experiments, the same constructs were expressed
in Expi293F GnTI cells. The protein tags were cleaved overnight with
thrombin and deglycosylated with EndoH. The RBD was mixed with a
1.3 molar excess of hACE2 and the complex was purified by SEC.
Biolayer Interferometry
Purified Avi-tagged RBD was biotinylated using a BirA biotin-protein
ligase kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Avidity). The
biotinylated RBDs at 100 nM were immobilized to SA sensors. A 1:2
dilution series of hACE2 starting at 100 nM in PBS-BSA buffer was used
in cycles of 200 s association followed by 200 s dissociation steps to
determine protein–protein affinity. The data were baseline-subtracted
and the plots fitted using the Pall FortéBio/Sartorius analysis software
(version 12.0). Data were plotted in Prism 9.1.0.
Crystallization and data collection
Crystals of complex BANAL-236 RBD/hACE2 were obtained at 4 °C in
sitting drops by mixing 200 nl of the protein complex at 8 mg/mL with
200 nl of reservoir solution containing 0.2 M lithium sulfate, 0.1 M Tris
8.5, 30 % w/v PEG 4000. The crystals were soaked in reservoir solution
containing 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant before being flash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data was collected on the beamline
PROXIMA 1 at the SOLEIL synchrotron (St Aubin, France) and reduced
using the XDS package68. The structure of the complex was determined
by molecular replacement with Phaser software69 using the coordinates
of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with hACE2 as search template (Protein
Data Bank (PDB) 6M0J). The model was manually corrected in COOT70
and refined with phenix.refine71. The final coordinates were deposited
in the PDB with the entry code 7PKI.
Molecular Dynamics simulations of RBD/hACE2 complexes
Generation of homology models. Homology models of the BANAL-236
and BANAL-52/103 RBD/hACE2 complexes were constructed using the
X-ray structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/hACE2 complex (PDB code
6M0J; resolution 2.45 Å) as template using MODELLER v. 10.172. These
models included the fragments S19-D615 and T333-G526 of hACE2 and
RBD, respectively, which were the regions resolved in the template. In
these regions, BANAL-236 and BANAL-52/103 RBDs have a sequence
identity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD equal to 96.9% and 97.4%, respectively.
The alignment reported in Extended Data Fig. 3 was used. The zinc
and chloride atoms present in the template were retained during
homology modeling; N-Acetylglucosamine (NAG) and water residues
were removed. 7 disulfide bonds were detected by MODELLER in the
template (3 in hACE2 and 4 in the RBD) and enforced in the generation
of the homology models using CHARMM-like distance and dihedral
angles restraints. For each construct, 100 homology models were built
and ranked based on the normalized DOPE score73. The top 3 scoring
models of each complex were used as starting points of 3 independent
MD simulations, as described in the following section.
Details of the MD simulations: setup, equilibration, and production.
The 6 homology models described in the previous section along with
the X-ray structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/hACE2 complex (PDB code
6M0J) were used as input to the CHARMM-GUI server74. In the case of
the X-ray structure, for consistency with the homology models, the
zinc and chloride atoms present in 6M0J were retained while the NAG
and water residues were removed. The 7 systems were solvated in a
triclinic box of initial x-y-z dimensions of ~13.5 nm * 9.2 nm * 8.3 nm.
Potassium and chloride ions were added to ensure charge neutrality
at a salt concentration of 0.15 M. The total number of atoms was
~104000. Additional details of the systems are reported in Table S4.
The CHARMM36m force field75 was used for the protein and ions and the
TIP3P model76 was used for the water molecules. CHARMM36m force
field parameters for the 7 pairs of cysteines linked by disulfide bonds
were used. The CHARMM-GUI models were first energy-minimized
using the steepest descent algorithm. After minimization, the
systems were equilibrated using a 1-ns long simulation in the NPT
ensemble followed by a 1-ns long simulation in the NVT ensemble.
The temperature T was set at 300 K and the pressure P at 1 atm using the
Bussi-Donadio-Parrinello thermostat77 and the Berendsen barostat78,
respectively. During equilibration, harmonic restraints on the positions
of the protein backbone and sidechains heavy atoms were applied. For
each system studied, production simulations were performed in the
NVT ensemble for 1 µs. A time step of 2 fs was used together with LINCS
constraints on h-bonds79. The van der Waals interactions were gradually
switched off at 1.0 nm and cut off at 1.2 nm; the particle-mesh Ewald
method was used to calculate electrostatic interactions with cutoff at
1.2 nm80. Production simulations were performed at room temperature
for consistency with the BLI experiments.
Details of the analysis. To evaluate the stability of the starting model
during the production simulations, we calculated the backbone Root
Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) with respect to the energy-minimized
structure for each frame of the trajectories. The RMSD was calculated
separately for the residues in: RBD (Extended Data Fig. 5A), hACE2
(Extended Data Fig. 5B), RBD-hACE2 interface (Extended Data Fig. 5C),
and in the entire complex (Extended Data Fig. 5D). Interfacial residues
were defined as the residues in one subunit closer than 0.8 nm to the
residues in the other subunit in the X-ray structure of the SARS-Cov-2
RBD/hACE2 complex. RMSD calculations were performed using the
driver utility of PLUMED v. 2.781. To characterize conformational
heterogeneity at the RBD-hACE2 interface, we performed a cluster
analysis of the MD trajectories using as similarity metrics the backbone
RMSD of the interfacial residues and the GROMOS clustering approach82
with a cutoff equal to 0.2 nm. The 9 trajectories were first concatenated,
clustering was then performed, and finally the population of each
cluster was calculated separately for each trajectory (Extended Data
Fig. 5E). To estimate the binding energy between RBD and hACE2,
we used the InterfaceAnalyzer tool in ROSETTA v. 3.1183 (Extended
Data Fig. 6A) and the AnalyseComplex tool in FoldX v. 484 (Extended
Data Fig. 6B). To identify relevant interactions at the RBD and hACE2
interface that could contribute to the binding affinity of the complex,
we quantified the frequency of formation of inter-subunits salt bridges
(Fig. 3b) and hydrogen bonds Extended Data Fig. 7) during the course of
the MD simulations. For each frame of the trajectories, we used PLUMED
to calculate the distances between the sidechain charged groups of
aspartic acids (OD1/OD2), glutamic acids (OE1/OE2), lysines (NZ), and
arginines (NH1/NH2). An inter-subunits salt bridge was then defined as
formed if the distance between groups with opposite charge was lower
than 0.32 nm. We confirmed this calculation using the Salt Bridges tool
available in VMD85. To monitor the formation of inter-subunits hydrogen
bonds, we used the Hydrogen Bond Analysis module of the MDAnalysis
library v. 1.0.086. A donor-acceptor distance and angular cutoffs of 0.3
nm and 150° were used to define the formation of a hydrogen bond. We
confirmed this calculation using the Hydrogen Bonds tool available
in VMD.
