## "The Fifth Column"

   `The Fifth Column` :: Small group on the inside, with goal of undermining establishment

- *Putin used the term 2022/03/17, refering to protesters within as the Fifth Column.*

  - Alternative view : _Putin_ and his _small group_ promoting war are the _true Fifth Column_, underming the establishment and pushing Russia toward a status as a failed state.




## Melitopol

  `Situation in Occupied Melitopol` :: Russian occupation losing around 2 troops / wk. to resistance movement acting at night. Unsustainable for an occupying force. [^1]
